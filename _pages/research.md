**COP30 challenges: Where are employment and income in the Brazilian bioeconomy (2011-2021)**, written by Paz, E. G. N., & Nogueira, J. M. *RP3 - Revista de Pesquisas em Políticas Públicas, 1, 197–235, 2025.* <br/>

This article addresses the lack of comparable metrics to guide analysis of the bioeconomy in Brazil, a topic that has been treated as a driver of development and climate change but lacks comparable metrics to guide policies and investments. This article aims to measure and characterize the 100% BIO core using microdata from the RAIS (2011–2021) based on two indicators: the core's share of formal employment and its share of the wage bill. This is a quantitative-descriptive study, with sectoral (CNAE) and territorial breakdowns and an assessment of the temporal evolution of these indicators. The results show stability in the share of formal employment at a constant level and a similar share of the wage bill, with a slight increase at the end of the series. Behind this average stability, spatial reconfiguration is observed, with relative gains in the Central-West and South regions, associated with agro-industrial densification, and a loss of traction of traditional primary complexes in states in the Southeast and Northeast. At the sectoral level, the transformation links linked to biomass stand out, such as food and beverage processing, slaughter and dairy, and the pulp and paper chain. In new agricultural fronts, formal employment remained resilient in the 2020–2021 biennium, but gaps persist between employment and income participation where local processing is incipient. In light of these findings, the two indicators used allow prioritizing territories and monitoring initiatives by revealing where the 100% BIO core generates not only formal jobs but also a greater share of income. The study's contribution is to offer standardized and replicable measurement with administrative data, enabling sectoral and territorial comparisons and continuous monitoring of the Brazilian bioeconomy.

**Entrepreneurship or Informality in Disguise? The Illusion of Autonomy in Digital Platforms and Its Effects on Labor Rights**, written by PAZ, E. G. N.; CARVALHO, R. G. *Anais eletrônicos do Encontro intermediário da ABET-UFPB - O futuro do trabalho em debate : por um olhar periférico. João Pessoa: CCTA, 2024, 1, p.13 - 28, 2024.* <br/>

<div id="INFORM" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
The article examines platform mediated work in Brazil as a reconfigured form of informality presented through the rhetoric of entrepreneurship and autonomy. Using PNAD Contínua Annual 2022 data and engaging with the literature on structural informality and “uberization”, it argues that the flexibility promoted by digital platforms often conceals subordination and algorithmic control, shifting economic risks to workers while weakening labor and social security protections. The findings show a strong concentration in the Southeast, a predominantly male workforce, a substantial share of pardo and black workers, and a profile concentrated among those aged 25 to 39, with mainly intermediate levels of schooling. Most workers are classified as self employed, with high informality, widespread lack of social security contributions, long working hours, and earnings that rise with education, indicating dependence on platforms more than genuine autonomous choice. The article concludes that platform work tends to reproduce regional, racial, and gender inequalities and to sustain an “illusion of autonomy”, reinforcing the need for regulation that secures labor rights and social protection suited to this model.

His  article  investigates  the  influence  of  family  and  domestic  factors  on  women's  labor  market participation  in  Brazil,  with  an  emphasis  on  the  impact  of  having  young  children.  Using  a  Probit econometric regression model applied to data from the 2019 National Health Survey, complemented by marginal effects calculations, it examines how the presence of children under five years of age affects the probability of women's participation in the labor market. The study explores how barriers related to motherhood, combined with other socioeconomic factors, influence women's professional trajectories. The results reveal that the presence of young children reduces the probability of participation, with the impact varying according to the number of children. Additionally, factors such as education level, urban location,  and  marital  status  significantly  influence  participation,  highlighting  the  need  for  strategies  to address structural inequalities.

This paper aims to analyse and make visible the solidarity of economic small enterprises self-managed by women in the state of Paraíba, as productive activities developed from the way of life and experiences of women, also understood as survival strategies. From the selection of active women’s groups, field research was carried out seeking to identify the profile of women, the type of activity, the commercialization strategies and difficulties in the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, among other aspects. The activities developed by women are concentrated notably in handicrafts, family agriculture and food production, with the commercialization of products in fixed or itinerant fairs. The self-management of the small enterprises and the limitation of financial resources were highlighted as the main difficulties for the maintenance of the groups. Women in the solidarity economy play an important role in building sociability and transmitting knowledge in their communities.

In a context of transformations in the labor market and fluctuations in unemployment rates, this study analyzes the relationship between wages and unemployment in urban Brazil from 2012 to 2023, focusing on wage curves for formal and informal workers and their regional implications. The analysis employs microdata from the PNAD-C, disaggregated by federative units, and estimates wage equations corrected for sample selection bias through a multinomial logit model, which explicitly considers the categories of formal employment, informal employment, and non-employment, based on household characteristics that influence occupational status. Spatial effects are also incorporated through three spatial weight matrices (distance, contiguity, and economic activity), which capture the impacts of neighboring unemployment rates on wages. The results confirm the existence of a spatial wage curve, with greater sensitivity of informal workers to both local and regional unemployment rates, especially among men. Workers with higher educational attainment also show increased sensitivity to economic shocks, challenging the expectation of greater wage stability. The analysis highlights the duality of the Brazilian labor market, where the informal sector exhibits greater vulnerability and wage flexibility. These findings contribute to the debate on labor market segmentation and public policies aimed at reducing regional wage inequalities.

**Wage curves for formal and informal workers: An analysis for urban Brazil between 2012 and 2023**, written by Paz, E. G. N. *Repositório Institucional da Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 2025.* <br/> 
<small>[<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="visib('formals')">Abstract</a> | [Paper][formals] ] </small>

<div id="formals" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
In an economic scenario marked by significant fluctuations in unemployment rates and transformations in the labor market, this study's main objective is to investigate the relationship between wages and unemployment in Brazil, focusing on understanding wage curves and their implications for the labor market. To achieve this goal, individual wages of formal and informal workers are examined, with particular attention to the geographical distribution of the federal units for the calculation of regional unemployment rates. The data is sourced from the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios Contínua (PNAD-C), covering the period from 2012 to 2023. The empirical analysis consists of estimating wage curves with the necessary corrections for sample selectivity of employed individuals, as well as accounting for possible spatial effects of regional unemployment rates. To correct for potential sample selectivity, a multinomial logit model was employed, which examines the probability of labor force participation, explicitly considering formal employment, informal employment, and non-employment, based on household characteristics that determine individuals' employment status. An innovative aspect of this research is the incorporation of spatial weights based on economic activity, capable of capturing the wage pressures faced by workers due to rising unemployment rates in other states. Additionally, the weighting of selection for formal and informal employment seems important when measuring the magnitude of wage curves. The results suggest the validity of the spatial wage curve relationship in Brazil, both for formal and informal workers. The analysis reveals that informal workers' wages are more sensitive to unemployment rates in their own region and neighboring locations, compared to formal workers' wages. This pattern holds for both men and women, but the magnitude of wage elasticity is slightly more pronounced for informal male workers compared to what is estimated for women working in the informal sector. Moreover, individuals with higher education levels show greater sensitivity to economic shocks, especially when considering spatial influences, revealing that higher qualifications do not necessarily imply greater wage stability.

**Income inequality by gender in Northeast Brazil: An analysis of changes between 2019 and 2023.**, written by Paz, E. G. N., Ferreira, C. R. A., Brito, D. J. M., Silva, M. V. A. E., & Moura, K. H.

Income disparities between men and women are a prominent feature of Brazilian society, with significant economic and social implications. Understanding these disparities is crucial to supporting effective public policies and promoting a more equitable society. This study analyzes income differences between men and women in Northeast Brazil using data from the Continuous National Household Sample Survey (PNAD-C) for 2019 and 2023. The methodology employed involves the decomposition of the income differential between men and women, both on average and by quantile, based on the procedures of Oaxaca-Blinder (1973) and Chernozhukov, Fernández-Val, and Melly (2013). In both procedures, wage equations are estimated by correcting for selection bias observed in the labor market through the Heckman (1979) procedure. The main findings reveal that wage disparities between men and women remain significant, with variations over time and across different income quantiles. There are indications that a general reduction in wage disparity occurred between 2019 and 2023, which may be attributed to structural changes in the labor market and policy interventions. However, the magnitude of the reduction varies by income level, indicating distinct impacts among women in different income brackets. Factors such as occupational segregation and caregiving responsibilities influence the observed wage differences. In this context, the findings highlight the need for more effective policies to address these inequalities, as well as the importance of monitoring and adapting gender equality strategies to economic and social changes.

**Brazilian ports and the environment: Critical analysis and perspectives for sustainability.**, written by Paz, E. G. N., & Nogueira, J. M. *Anais do IV Encontro de Economia do Agreste Pernambucano - ECONAPE. Caruaru - PE: UFPE/CAA, 2024* <br/>

<div id="portos" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Ports play a strategic role in the global economy, facilitating approximately 80% of world trade and connecting regions around the planet, which is important for countries' economic competitiveness. The increasing demand and expansion of port infrastructure have generated significant environmental impacts, such as air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity, and degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems. These problems are particularly severe in less developed regions, where inadequate infrastructure exacerbates regional inequalities and limits sustainable development. Based on Castro's study (2022), this article investigates the contrast between the economic importance of ports and environmental challenges, analyzing ANTAQ's Environmental Performance Index (EPI) and expanding the discussion to the period from 2012 to 2022. To compare the environmental performance of public and private ports in Brazil, it evaluates indicators such as energy efficiency, waste management, and environmental monitoring. Methodological procedures include a literature review and analysis of data from the EPI and shipping statistics, aiming to propose improvements and policies for port sustainability. The study reveals that public ports have superior environmental performance than private ports and highlights that the effectiveness of policies depends on the interaction between management, location, types of cargo, and investment capacity, elements that influence the environmental impact of port operations.

The income disparity between men and women is a prominent characteristic of Brazilian society, with significant economic and social implications. Understanding this disparity is crucial for formulating effective public policies and promoting a more equitable society. This  study analyzes the income difference between men and women in the Brazilian Northeast, using data from the Continuous National Household Sample Survey (PNADc) from the first quarter of 2019 and 2023. The methodology used is the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. The results show that the gender wage gap persists significantly, with variations over time and across different income quantiles. A general reduction in the wage gap is observed in the postpandemic period, attributed to structural changes in the labor market and policy interventions. However, the magnitude of the reduction varies according to income level, indicating distinct impacts among women of different income brackets. Factors such as occupational segregation and caregiving responsibilities continue to influence wage differences. The research highlights the need for more effective policies to address these inequalities and the importance of monitoring and adapting gender equality strategies to economic and social changes.

**The working conditions of drivers and delivery workers through digital platforms and the continuity of submission to capital.**, written by Paz, E. G. N., & Carvalho, R. G. *Anais do XXIX Encontro Nacional de Economia Política. Marabá: Sociedade Brasileira de Economia Política (SEP), 2024.* <br/>

Technological changes have caused significant alterations in capitalist society, affecting not only access to markets for goods and services, but also redesigning production and labor relations, which tends to reconfigure capital's control over labor. With the emergence of digital platforms, driven by information technology, a new work model based on greater job flexibility has been expanding. This study investigates the context of work on these platforms, focusing on the delivery and passenger transportation sectors in Brazil. The term "uberization" has been used to express the relationship between workers and digital platforms. In addition to reviewing the literature on work and uberization, this study uses data from Ipea and FairWork Brazil to examine the implications of working on digital platforms. The main characteristics of drivers and delivery workers were identified by gender, race, education, working hours and income. One of the main findings in this new working relationship is the lack of recognition by companies of an employment relationship with workers. They assume a position of autonomy, bearing the risks and costs of their work, while lacking basic labor rights. Uberization promotes the management of work through algorithms, which enhances impersonality in the social work relationship and expresses a new form of labour exploitation in order to perpetuate the precariousness of work.

**The new work model on digital platforms: an analysis of the profile of workers in the delivery services and passenger transportation sectors in Brazil**, written by Paz, E. G. N. *Repositório Institucional da Universidade Federal da Paraíba, 2023.* <br/> 
<small>[<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="visib('plat')">Abstract</a> | [Paper][plat] ] </small>

<div id="plat" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Technological transformations have provided structural changes in the capitalist system over time, changing the way contemporary society accesses markets for goods and services. However, above all, it altered the social relations of production and work in order to improve control over workers. Information technologies supported the emergence of digital platforms as an environment for a new work model. In this sense, the main objective of this work is to address the context of the work carried out through digital platforms and to analyze the profile of those workers in the sectors of delivery services and passenger transport in Brazil. The literature uses the term “uberization” of work to characterize the way workers relate to digital platforms. To understand this context, it was necessary to theoretically consider the main factors that serve as determinants of the work flexibility process and the new work modalities that develop in the digital economy, also contributing to the informalization of work. Beyond the bibliographical research on the subject of work in the digital economy and uberization, this work used secondary data provided by Ipea, based on the PNAD Contínua, and FairWork Brasil, a project based at the University of Oxford, to monitor the consequences of platform work. We sought to bring questions that characterize the profile of workers who make up the sectors of delivery service and passenger transport in Brazil, considering gender, race/color, level of education, working hours and income. Among the main results, it was shown that the dominant companies in the sector do not recognize the activities carried out by workers in order to characterize an employment relationship. In general, workers adopt an attitude of autonomy, assume the risks and costs of work and do not enjoy basic labor rights such as vacations and retirement. Therefore, the uberization of work can express a new stage in the exploitation of work managed through an algorithm and characterize the continuity of precarious work.

**Uberization of Work: The Precarization of App-Based Delivery Workers in Brazil**, written by SILVA, E. F.; PAZ, E. G. N. *Anais do Encontro Nacional da ABET: Crises e horizontes do trabalho a partir da periferia. Uberlândia - MG: Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, 2021.* <br/>

<div id="platf" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This article aims to analyze the context of the precarization of labor relations and working conditions among app-based delivery workers, in light of the rise of new business models in the digital economy. Accordingly, it seeks to examine the circumstances under which digital platforms began to shape new forms of managing the distribution of goods and services. The article intends to identify the main features of their reproduction in Brazil’s national labor market and to determine the most representative pattern of working conditions among app-based couriers with respect to working hours, earnings, and rights. The discussion is grounded in specialized scientific literature on the topic and in the analysis of indicators related to couriers’ working conditions, based on published statistics and recent studies by researchers of labor and employment. The results confirm the broader context of precarization in the Brazilian labor market. A substantial share of app-based couriers work longer hours than wage employees. They earn less, bear the operating and maintenance costs of delivery work, face higher risks, and do not enjoy the basic labor rights guaranteed to workers regulated under the CLT. This reality worsened as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 onward. It is necessary to regulate the operations of digital economy companies and their relationship with worker-users and consumers, as well as to recognize the new employment relationship established with couriers, so as to ensure better working conditions and the effective protection of essential rights.
